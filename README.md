## Overview
Classification of strawberry purees using MIR spectroscopy. This project used some more 'modern' machine learning techniques including: 
<ul>
  <li>random forest</li> 
  <li>rotation forest</li> 
  <li>XGBoost</li> 
  <li>KNN</li> 
</ul>

These models were used to classify whether a fruit puree did or did not contain strawberry. They were contrasted with PLS-DA, a traditional chemometric classification technique, to observe accuracy differences. Also contains, quick summaries of all above techniques, EDA, and data cleaning.
